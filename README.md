# Net Ninja Tutorial

The [Net Ninja Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwTNR3EBSJQ) was published on August 16, 2016.  I started working with it in January, 2017, and there were already some differences in the code that Angular 2 generated for me.

This is the initial code that `ng new ninja-directory` created for me.  To see the completed code, you must look at branch Lesson27.  To clone that code you can do this:
```
git clone https://github.com/amnotafraid/ninja-directory -b Lesson27
```

When I typed `ng -v` on the command line, I got this:
```
angular-cli: 1.0.0-beta.24
node: 6.0.0
os: darwin x64
@angular/common: 2.4.4
@angular/compiler: 2.4.4
@angular/core: 2.4.4
@angular/forms: 2.4.4
@angular/http: 2.4.4
@angular/platform-browser: 2.4.4
@angular/platform-browser-dynamic: 2.4.4
@angular/router: 3.4.4
@angular/compiler-cli: 2.4.4
```
